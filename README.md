> [!NOTE]
> :mega: Thank you for continuing your **support** of the **NET-AUTOMATE** Repository formerly known as ***CATC-TEMPLATES*** by your continued visits to the site. The site originally was intended to share template automation and orchestration information for Catalyst Center. While we will continue to have that as a focus, we have recently been adding support for the Dashboard environment and for Cisco Workflows. We are augmenting the labs and tutorials for Dashboard and Cisco Workflows as well.
>
> :mega: As with all things there is change. The name has changed again to stay relevant with Cisco Enterprise Networking Automation. To that end the first of the changes will be there will be additional automation content being added to the repo for: 
> 1. **Dashboard** to automate it. Labs and tutorials will again all be added to be as concise as possible.
> 2. **Cisco Workflows** which is generally available at now.
>
> Over the next few months you will **notice more lab updates** to the repository, as we **add** additional content. 

# Enterprise Networking Platforms 

## Catalyst Center

![Catalyst Center Overview](./ASSETS/COMMON/ROOT/cisco_catc.png)

Catalyst Center is an intelligent Automation and Assurance platform for the campus. Catalyst Center enables, simplified Day-0 through Day-N management of switching, routing, and wireless infrastructure. It also improves operations with AI/ML-enhanced analytics to streamline troubleshooting and provide actionable insights into the health of the network and the quality of experience for users and applications. Here are some of the capabilities of Catalyst Center in their respective domains:

* NetOps: Network Plug and Play for Zero Touch Deployment, Software Image Management, Compliance, Configuration Templates and Network Profiles, Model-Driven Configuration, and RMA Support.
* AIOps: AI/ML-enhanced monitoring and troubleshooting support. Predictive Insights, Network Baselines, Network Reasoner, Device/Client/Application 360, Intelligent Capture.
* SecOps: AI Endpoint Analytics, Group-Based Policy and Analytics, Software-Defined Access
* DevOps: ITSM Integrations, APIs, SDK & Ansible Module 

## Dashboard

![Dashboard Overview](./ASSETS/COMMON/ROOT/cisco_meraki.png)

Dashboard is a cloud-managed networking platform that unifies configuration, monitoring, and security across distributed networks. It delivers streamlined Day-0 through Day-N operations for wireless, switching, security appliances, SD-WAN, cameras, and IoT, all from a single, intuitive web interface. Powered by cloud analytics and automation, Dashboard accelerates deployment, simplifies troubleshooting, and provides actionable insights into network health, user experience, and security posture. Here are some of the capabilities of Dashboard in their respective domains:

* NetOps: Zero-touch provisioning with Cloud provisioning and templates, centralized configuration and change management, firmware management, network cloning, topology views, and automatic VPN.
* AIOps: Cloud-powered analytics and anomaly detection, client and device health insights, application visibility and performance metrics, intelligent alerts, and recommended fixes.
* SecOps: Integrated next-gen firewall, IPS/IDS, content filtering, malware protection, Zero Trust policies with Adaptive Policy (group-based policy), and secure SD-WAN with threat analytics.
* DevOps: Comprehensive REST APIs and webhooks, dashboard and device APIs, ecosystem marketplace integrations, and automation via SDKs and templates.

# Overview

This Repository will give examples of templates used in Catalyst Center that can be modified. Additional information will be included to hopefully give a well rounded explanation of Automation methods with Templates using Catalyst Center and flows with both Onboarding and DayN Templates and concepts.

The repository will include scripts and examples with the following:

1. Template Scripting for both Jinja and Velocity
2. Variable notation and usage
3. Binding Variables
4. System Variables
5. Regular Templates
6. Composite Templates
7. Cisco Workflows
8. REST-API automation utilizing:
   - Postman, and Bruno
   - Python and SDK's
9. Orchestrations utilizing: 
   - Cisco Workflows
   - Ansible
   - NSO
   - CICD Pipelines using:
     - Jenkins
     - GitLab Pipeline
     - GithHub Actions 

The goal of this repository is a practical guide to allow engineers to rapidly begin using Catalyst Center automation and begin conversion of IOS CLI Templates. The Templates have been developed over the years and with various use cases in mind, and so the intent of sharing this collection is to reduce the lift to begin automating.

## Intent Based Networking

Either one or multiple Templates may be used to deploy Intent in combination with the Design Settings and Policies deployed within the UI. One or Multiple templates may be used in Onboarding (PnP) or Day N methods. Day N methods are designed for making ongoing changes and may require 'no' statements depending on the configuration construct being modified. 

Additionally:

1.	Intent can be defined as the set of code along with the configuration constructs deployed via a template.
2.	Variables can be used to modify or choose between constructs deployed via decision (‘IF’) statements
3.	Repetition of any construct may be introduced through the use of Looping structures on any device.
4.	Variables may be used when the device is being onboarded or provisioned

# LAB Resources

## Overview

As a quick start with Catalyst Center Automation, you may utilize the above labs in conjuction with DCLOUD's sandbox:

1. [Cisco Enterprise Networks Hardware Sandbox West DC](https://DCLOUD2-sjc.cisco.com/content/catalogue?search=Enterprise%20Networks%20Hardware%20Sandbox&screenCommand=openFilterScreen)
2. [Cisco Enterprise Networks Hardware Sandbox East DC](https://DCLOUD2-rtp.cisco.com/content/catalogue?search=Enterprise%20Networks%20Hardware%20Sandbox&screenCommand=openFilterScreen)

This allows you to run these labs and gives not only an environment to try the various code samples, but also to develop and export your own code for use in your production environment. DCLOUD  provides for rapid and safe POC/POV on-demand environment without impacting production environments. DCLOUD also negates the need for shipping equipment, associated lead times, and licensing issues associated with setting up your own private testing environment. Please do adhere to the best practices for the DCLOUD environment when using it.

DCLOUD allows for use with a web-based browser client for VPN-less connectivity, as well as AnyConnect VPN client connectivity for those who prefer it. The labs are hosted in Cisco San Jose Facility (Select US East or US West Region when scheduling in DCLOUD). Choose the Cisco Enterprise Network Sandbox version you prefer. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To access this or any other content, including demonstrations, labs, and training in DCLOUD please **work with** your **Cisco Account team** or **Cisco Partner Account Team** directly. Your Account teams will make sure the session is scheduled and shared for you to use. Once booked follow the guide within Github to complete the tasks adhering to the best practices of the DCLOUD environment.

# [Templates Store](https://github.com/kebaldwi/DNAC-TEMPLATES/tree/master/CODE#code-)

This **CODE** repository is built out to share Catalyst Center Automations and Templates and allow for ongoing submissions from those inclined to share their work with the community.

# [Practical Template Examples](https://github.com/kebaldwi/DNAC-TEMPLATES/blob/master/TUTORIALS/ExamplesAndConcepts.md)

In this section I have compiled a number of template examples built with Jinja2 Language. These samples include a wide ranging set of configurations which may be used in your labs to solve specific configuration requirements. This collection summarizes aspects covered previously in this templating repository, and are aimed at providing quick practical references to help engineers solve automation tasks with the help of Catalyst Center. Additionally these examples may be used in testing in [DCLOUD](https://DCLOUD.cisco.com) with any of the labs on this repository.
