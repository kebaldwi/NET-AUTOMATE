This folder holds the Catalyst Center workflow JSON exports used throughout this repository. Workflows are grouped by maturity and intended consumption model into two subfolders:

| Subfolder | Purpose | Status |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| [EXCHANGE/](EXCHANGE/) | Production-ready, polished `-v3` end-to-end suite that is **published in Cisco Workflows** (the in-product Workflow Exchange catalog inside Catalyst Center). | Recommended for new deployments |
| [CATC/](CATC/) | Workflow library of original `CATC-*` building blocks and the first-generation `GitOps-*` v1 build chain. Many EXCHANGE workflows are evolved from, or reuse, the workflows in this folder. | Reference and reuse as subworkflows |

## EXCHANGE — Production Suite (Published in Cisco Workflows)

Folder: [EXCHANGE/](EXCHANGE/) — see the suite documentation in [EXCHANGE/README.md](EXCHANGE/README.md).

The EXCHANGE folder contains the **twelve-workflow `-v3` production suite** that delivers an end-to-end GitOps build-and-deploy chain for Catalyst Center, plus operations and reusable utility workflows, and two standalone day-2 switch port modifier tools (one for Catalyst Center-managed switches and one for Cisco Meraki cloud-managed switches). Every workflow in this folder is **published in Cisco Workflows** — the in-product Workflow Exchange catalog accessed from Catalyst Center under *Platform → Automation → Exchange* — so customers can install them directly from the catalog inside Catalyst Center without manually importing JSON.

Use cases solved by the EXCHANGE suite:

| # | Workflow | Use Case Solved |
|---|----------|-----------------|
| 1.0 | [Site Hierarchy](EXCHANGE/1.0-Cisco-Catalyst-Center-Site-Hierarchy/) | Build and maintain the Area / Building / Floor site hierarchy from a single source of truth in GitHub. |
| 2.0 | [Settings and Credentials](EXCHANGE/2.0-Cisco-Catalyst-Center-Settings-and-Credentials/) | Apply network settings (DNS, DHCP, NTP, SNMP, syslog, banner, AAA, Netflow) and assign CLI / SNMP credentials to sites. |
| 3.0 | [Device Discovery and Assign](EXCHANGE/3.0-Cisco-Catalyst-Center-Device-Discovery-and-Assign/) | Run Catalyst Center discovery jobs and assign discovered devices to their target sites. |
| 4.0 | [Templates GitHub Integration](EXCHANGE/4.0-Cisco-Catalyst-Center-Templates-Github-integration/) | Synchronise DayN member templates from a GitHub repository into a Template Hub project. |
| 5.0 | [Templates Composite](EXCHANGE/5.0-Cisco-Catalyst-Center-Templates-Composite/) | Build composite templates from YAML definitions in GitHub and commit them in Template Hub. |
| 6.0 | [Network Profile](EXCHANGE/6.0-Cisco-Catalyst-Center-Network-Profile/) | Bind a switching network profile to a site with Day0 and DayN template IDs. |
| 7.0 | [Provision Composite](EXCHANGE/7.0-Cisco-Catalyst-Center-Provision-Composite/) | Provision (or re-provision) managed devices and deploy the composite template at a site. |
| 8.0 | [Command Runner](EXCHANGE/8.0-Cisco-Catalyst-Center-Command-Runner/) | Run up to five read-only show commands on a managed device via the CLI Poller API for ad-hoc verification. |
| 9.0 | [Site Based Upgrade](EXCHANGE/9.0-Cisco-Catalyst-Center-Site-Based-Upgrade/) | Orchestrate site-scoped SWIM upgrades — golden image preparation, distribution, activation, and pre/post-check diagnostics. |
| 9.1 | [Site Based Upgrade with AI](EXCHANGE/9.1-Cisco-Catalyst-Center-Site-Based-Upgrade-with-AI/) | AI-enhanced variant of 9.0 — the same site-scoped SWIM upgrade plus a GenAI (Anthropic `claude-opus-4-7`) post-upgrade validation report with per-device PASS/WARN/FAIL verdicts. |
| 10.0 | [Paginated Device Inventory](EXCHANGE/10.0-Cisco-Catayst-Center-Paginated-Device-Inventory/) | Reusable utility — paginate the full device inventory and return a merged, optionally filtered device list. |
| 11.0 | [Paginated Site Hierarchy](EXCHANGE/11.0-Cisco-Catalyst-Center-Paginated-Site-Hierarchy/) | Reusable utility — paginate the complete site hierarchy and return merged JSON plus name and UUID lists. |
| 12.0 | [Bulk Command Runner](EXCHANGE/12.0-Cisco-Catalyst-Center-Bulk-Command-Runner/) | Reusable utility — iterate a shared device table, batch show commands in groups of five, and record pre/post-change diagnostics. |
| 14.0 | [Catalyst Center Switch Port Modifier](EXCHANGE/14.0-Cisco-Catalyst-Center-Switch-Port-Modifier/) | Day-2 operations tool — interactively locate a switch port by client MAC or device/port and modify description, admin status, and/or data/voice VLANs, deploying the change (with optional port bounce on RESET). |
| 15.0 | [Meraki Switch Port Modifier](EXCHANGE/15.0-Cisco-Meraki-Switch-Port-Modifier/) | Day-2 operations tool — select a Meraki organization / network / switch, verify cloud management, and modify port description, admin status, VLANs, and (access ports) access policy across one or more ports via the Meraki Dashboard API. |

Net outcome: a deterministic, version-controlled, end-to-end build of a Catalyst Center site — from empty hierarchy to provisioned devices with deployed composite templates — plus operational tooling for diagnostics, site-scoped upgrades, and interactive day-2 switch port changes on both Catalyst Center-managed and Meraki cloud-managed switches.

## CATC — Workflow Library and Building Blocks

Folder: [CATC/](CATC/) — see the library documentation in [CATC/README.md](CATC/README.md).

The CATC folder is the **workflow library**. It contains the original `CATC-*` building-block workflows and the first-generation `GitOps-*` build chain that preceded the EXCHANGE `-v3` suite. These workflows are retained in the repository for reference, for reuse as subworkflows, and to support customers still running the earlier chain.

The contents fall into four functional groups:

| Group | Workflows | Use Case Solved |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|
| **CATC building blocks** | `CATC-BuildHierarchy-v2`, `CATC-AssignSettings-v2`, `CATC-CreateTemplate-v2`, `CATC-GitHubIntegration-v2`, `CATC-DeviceDiscovery`, `CATC-PortConfiguration` | Small, reusable workflows that each wrap one or a few Catalyst Center Intent API calls — composable into larger pipelines. |
| **Read-only utilities** | `CATC-GetHierarchy`, `CATC-DeviceInventory`, `CATC-CommandRunner` | Inspection helpers used as subworkflows by the rest of the suite (hierarchy snapshot, device inventory snapshot, ad-hoc show commands). |
| **Brown-field onboarding** | `CATC-BrownFieldOnboarding-v2`, `CATC-BrownFieldOnboarding-v3` | IBNS-based end-to-end onboarding of existing switches (discovery → normalisation → provisioning). |
| **GitOps v1 build chain** | `GitOps-BuildHierarchy`, `GitOps-BuildSettings`, `GitOps-DeviceDiscovery`, `GitOps-ImportTemplates`, `GitOps-BuildCompositeTemplate`, `GitOps-BuildNetworkProfile`, `GitOps-DeviceProvisioning` | First-generation GitHub-driven build chain — each workflow wraps the matching CATC building block and reads its intent from a GitHub repository. |

The CATC library is **not** packaged in the Workflow Exchange catalog. It is consumed directly from this repository — either by importing the JSON manually into Catalyst Center, or by referencing the individual workflows as subworkflows from other automations.

## Relationship Between the Two Folders

```
EXCHANGE/  ──►  Polished -v3 production chain    ──►  Published in Cisco Workflows
   ▲
   │ evolved from / reuses
   │
CATC/      ──►  CATC-* building blocks + GitOps v1 chain    ──►  Reference / subworkflow reuse
```

- Each `-v3` workflow in EXCHANGE is the productised successor of a workflow (or set of workflows) in CATC.
- Several EXCHANGE workflows still call into CATC workflows as subworkflows (for example, the EXCHANGE Command Runner is the same `CATC-CommandRunner.json` from the library).
- The CATC folder is the historical and structural foundation. The EXCHANGE folder is the supported, catalog-published surface.

---

## Which Folder Should I Use?

- **For a new production deployment** — use [EXCHANGE/](EXCHANGE/). Install directly from the Workflow Exchange catalog inside Catalyst Center, or import the JSON files from this folder. Follow the ordered installation in [EXCHANGE/README.md](EXCHANGE/README.md).
- **For learning, building your own workflows, or reusing subworkflows** — start in [CATC/](CATC/). The building-block workflows are smaller and easier to read, and they are the source patterns that the EXCHANGE suite is built on.
- **For customers still on the v1 GitOps chain** — keep using the `GitOps-*` workflows in [CATC/](CATC/) until you can plan a cut-over to the EXCHANGE `-v3` suite.
