This document describes the complete Cisco Catalyst Center GitOps workflow suite under this folder. The suite consists of the twelve ordered GitOps and utility workflows that automate site foundation, settings and credentials, discovery and assignment, template synchronization, composite template construction, profile binding, composite deployment, ad-hoc device CLI diagnostics, site-scoped software upgrades, the paginated inventory/hierarchy utilities that the upgrade pipeline depends on, and the bulk show-command runner that captures pre/post-change diagnostics across many devices. It additionally includes two operational day-2 port-modifier workflows: one for Catalyst Center-managed access switches (14.0) and one for Cisco Meraki cloud-managed switches (15.0).

Workflows 1.0 through 7.0 form the core GitOps build-and-deploy chain. Workflow 8.0 provides ad-hoc CLI read access for verification. Workflow 9.0 orchestrates site-scoped SWIM upgrades, and it consumes the reusable pagination utilities in Workflows 10.0 and 11.0 as well as the bulk command runner in Workflow 12.0. Workflows 14.0 and 15.0 are standalone, prompt-driven day-2 operations tools for interactive switch port changes and are independent of the GitOps build chain.

## Business Drivers

This workflow suite is designed to support enterprise and public-sector operational goals:

1. Speed to service
- Compresses multi-team manual provisioning steps into an ordered, repeatable workflow chain.
- Reduces deployment lead time for new sites and pods.

2. Operational consistency
- Enforces a single source of truth from version-controlled project settings and template artifacts.
- Reduces configuration drift across locations by reusing deterministic automation paths.

3. Risk reduction
- Uses idempotent, API-driven operations with explicit dependency ordering and task polling.
- Lowers change-failure rates caused by skipped prerequisites or inconsistent execution order.

4. Governance and auditability
- Every change to topology intent and template content can be traced to Git history and workflow execution logs.
- Supports CAB and compliance reporting with reproducible run outcomes.

5. Scale enablement
- Supports multi-device and multi-site growth without proportional growth in manual effort.
- Standardizes onboarding and DayN rollout patterns across pods and regions.

## Provisioning Workflow

The diagram below shows the complete end-to-end build-and-deploy flow across workflows 1.0 through 7.0, the resources each stage produces, and the hard dependencies that gate the final deployment stage. Workflows 8.0 through 12.0 are utility and operations workflows that consume the same Catalyst Center state once it has been built.

### 8.0 - Command Runner

Workflow folder: [8.0-Cisco-Catalyst-Center-Command-Runner](8.0-Cisco-Catalyst-Center-Command-Runner/)

Function:
- Resolves a managed device by its management IP, submits up to five read-only show commands through the Catalyst Center CLI Poller API, polls the resulting task, retrieves the result file, and returns a cleaned, per-command report.
- Uses Catalyst Center's existing managed device channel; no per-device credentials and no SSH session are required at run time.

Primary outcome:
- Operator receives a sanitized, ready-to-display report of show command output for the target device.

Utilization statement:
- Use this workflow for ad-hoc diagnostics, change verification, and as a building block for higher-level workflows (for example, pre/post-check capture in 9.0).

### 9.0 - Site Based Upgrade

Workflow folder: [9.0-Cisco-Catalyst-Center-Site-Based-Upgrade](9.0-Cisco-Catalyst-Center-Site-Based-Upgrade/)

Function:
- Scopes a SWIM upgrade to a parent site and all of its child sites, intersects site-assigned devices with a filtered, reachable, managed inventory (via Workflow 10.0), and builds a target device table with pre-check diagnostics.
- Resolves the SWIM device family identifier, syncs and selects a golden image, and per site ensures the image is downloaded and golden-tagged.
- Executes operator-confirmed distribution and/or activation against selected devices, then captures post-check diagnostics into a shared SWIM inventory table.

Primary outcome:
- Selected devices in the chosen site hierarchy run the operator-selected golden image, with before/after CLI evidence captured.

Utilization statement:
- Use this workflow to perform controlled, site-scoped software upgrades with deterministic device targeting, explicit confirmation gates, and built-in pre/post-check verification.

### 9.1 - Site Based Upgrade with AI

Workflow folder: [9.1-Cisco-Catalyst-Center-Site-Based-Upgrade-with-AI](9.1-Cisco-Catalyst-Center-Site-Based-Upgrade-with-AI/)

Function:
- Runs the same site-scoped SWIM upgrade as Workflow 9.0 — hierarchy scoping, device intersection (via Workflow 10.0), golden image preparation, and operator-confirmed distribution and/or activation.
- After activation, refreshes the device inventory to record the booted software version and captures post-check diagnostics into the shared SWIM inventory table.
- Submits the combined pre/post-check table to a GenAI model (Anthropic `claude-opus-4-7`) primed with a Senior Network Engineer persona, which returns an audit-ready validation report.

Primary outcome:
- Selected devices run the operator-selected golden image, and the operator receives an evidence-based, per-device validation report (PASS / PASS WITH WARNINGS / FAIL / INCONCLUSIVE) suitable for attaching to a change ticket.

Utilization statement:
- Use this workflow when you want the controlled, site-scoped upgrade of Workflow 9.0 plus automated post-change validation. It additionally requires the `Anthropic-AI` GenAI endpoint target and the `ANTHROPIC-KEY` runtime credential.

### 10.0 - Paginated Device Inventory

Workflow folder: [10.0-Cisco-Catayst-Center-Paginated-Device-Inventory](10.0-Cisco-Catayst-Center-Paginated-Device-Inventory/)

Function:
- Counts the total managed device population, computes the required page count, then paginates the Network Device API and merges every page into one consolidated response.
- Applies an optional device-type filter (Switches and Hubs, Routers, Wireless Controllers, or ALL) intersected with reachable and managed state.

Primary outcome:
- Caller receives a complete (optionally filtered) device inventory as JSON, regardless of total device count.

Utilization statement:
- Use this workflow as a reusable building block whenever a workflow needs the full inventory without page-size truncation. It is consumed by Workflow 9.0.

### 11.0 - Paginated Site Hierarchy

Workflow folder: [11.0-Cisco-Catalyst-Center-Paginated-Site-Hierarchy](11.0-Cisco-Catalyst-Center-Paginated-Site-Hierarchy/)

Function:
- Counts the total site population, computes the required page count, then paginates the Site API and merges every page into one consolidated response.
- In the same pagination cadence, retrieves a corresponding page of device inventory so site and device data stay aligned.
- Extracts ready-to-consume `siteHierarchyNameList` and `siteHierarchyUuidList` outputs from the merged hierarchy.

Primary outcome:
- Caller receives the complete merged site hierarchy plus index-aligned name and UUID arrays for direct consumption.

Utilization statement:
- Use this workflow as a reusable building block whenever a workflow needs the full site hierarchy by name or UUID without page-size truncation.

### 12.0 - Bulk Command Runner

Workflow folder: [12.0-Cisco-Catalyst-Center-Bulk-Command-Runner](12.0-Cisco-Catalyst-Center-Bulk-Command-Runner/)

Function:
- Seeds a local `PreflightChecklist` working table from the shared global **Device SWIM Inventory** table and iterates row by row over every target device.
- Normalises a loose-format `showCommands` input (quoted CSV, JSON/Python list literal, or newline-separated) into an array and chunks it into batches of five to honour the Catalyst Center per-call command limit.
- Drives a `While Loop` that submits each batch to `CATC-CommandRunner` (POST `/network-device-poller/cli/read-request`), polls the resulting task, retrieves the result file, and concatenates the cleaned per-batch output per device.
- Writes the consolidated per-device output into either the `precheck` or `postcheck` column of the shared table, selected by the `TableColumnSelection` input.

Primary outcome:
- The shared **Device SWIM Inventory** table is updated in place so each device row carries its original inventory attributes alongside structured pre-change and/or post-change CLI evidence, ready for side-by-side comparison.

Utilization statement:
- Use this workflow as the reusable diagnostic engine for any change workflow that needs bulk pre/post-check capture across many devices. It is consumed by Workflow 9.0 for SWIM upgrade pre/post-checks and can be called from any parent workflow that populates the shared **Device SWIM Inventory** table.

### 14.0 - Catalyst Center Switch Port Modifier

Workflow folder: [14.0-Cisco-Catalyst-Center-Switch-Port-Modifier](14.0-Cisco-Catalyst-Center-Switch-Port-Modifier/)

Function:
- Interactively targets one or more access switch ports on a Catalyst Center-managed device, resolved either from a **client** (by MAC address, via client enrichment detail) or directly from a **network device** (by selecting a switch and its interfaces).
- Collects a composable change set through wizard prompts — description, administrative/operational status, and data and voice VLANs — and assembles the matching interface `PUT` body.
- Resolves each selected port's interface UUID, applies the change with `deploymentMode=Deploy`, and, when `RESET` is chosen for operational status, bounces the port (DOWN, wait 5 seconds, UP).

Primary outcome:
- The selected port(s) carry the operator-chosen description, status, and/or VLAN configuration, provisioned to the device.

Utilization statement:
- Use this workflow as a day-2 operations tool for targeted switch port changes when you know either the client identity or the device and port. It depends only on the device already being discovered and managed in Catalyst Center (Workflow 3.0) and is independent of the GitOps build chain.

### 15.0 - Meraki Switch Port Modifier

Workflow folder: [15.0-Cisco-Meraki-Switch-Port-Modifier](15.0-Cisco-Meraki-Switch-Port-Modifier/)

Function:
- Guides the operator through selecting a Meraki **organization**, **network**, and **switch**, verifies the device is cloud-managed via organization inventory, and lists its non-stack switch ports.
- Is **port-type aware**: Access ports expose data VLAN, voice VLAN, and access policy (Open or a resolved custom named policy); Trunk ports expose native VLAN and allowed VLANs. Description and admin status (ENABLE/DISABLE) apply to both.
- Resolves each selected port's `portId` and issues a Meraki Dashboard API `PUT /devices/{serial}/switch/ports/{portId}` per port, then returns a formatted results summary.

Primary outcome:
- The selected Meraki switch port(s) carry the operator-chosen description, status, VLAN, and (access ports) access policy configuration in the Meraki Dashboard.

Utilization statement:
- Use this workflow as a day-2 operations tool for Cisco Meraki cloud-managed switches. It requires a configured Meraki Dashboard API endpoint target and the device already claimed into the organization; it is independent of the Catalyst Center GitOps build chain.

---

## Input Data Sources

The workflow suite uses shared GitOps input artifacts:

1. Project settings JSON
- `Projects/<project>/Settings/settings.json`
- Consumed across hierarchy, settings, discovery, profile, and provisioning logic.

2. GitHub template source
- Referenced by workflows 4.0 and 5.0 for member and composite template synchronization.

3. Catalyst Center runtime state
- Workflows 8.0, 9.0, 10.0, 11.0, and 12.0 read live Catalyst Center inventory, hierarchy, and SWIM state directly through the Intent API rather than from Git artifacts.

4. Shared global tables
- Workflow 12.0 reads from and writes to the global **Device SWIM Inventory** table populated by the parent workflow (for example, Workflow 9.0). The same table carries device attributes and the `precheck`/`postcheck` columns updated per run.

---

## Installation Options

3. Search for the matching GitOps workflow titles.
4. Install each required workflow package and follow any installation instructions provided.
5. Validate input variables and API permissions before first run.
6. Execute in the same dependency order defined in this README.

Recommended when:
- You want faster first-time setup without manual file import.
- Your team prefers catalog-driven lifecycle operations.

Post-install validation for either option:

1. Confirm all workflows (the twelve GitOps/utility workflows plus the two day-2 port modifiers, 14.0 and 15.0) are visible and enabled.
2. Confirm runtime target, credentials, and required permissions are set.
3. Execute a non-production test run using a limited target scope.
4. Confirm task polling and terminal status behavior before production rollout.

## Meraki Free Account Setup (Optional Lab On-Ramp)

If you are new to Cisco workflow automation, a free Meraki Dashboard environment can be useful to practice API auth, inventory modeling, and network object workflows before production Catalyst Center changes.

Important:
- Meraki Dashboard workflows are not to be confused with Catalyst Center workflows. They are not the same and do not interact.
- This step is optional for the Catalyst Center workflows (1.0 through 12.0 and 14.0), which do not use the Meraki Dashboard.
- A Meraki Dashboard account with API access is **required** to run Workflow 15.0 (Meraki Switch Port Modifier), which operates entirely against the Meraki Dashboard API. Configure the resulting API key as the workflow's `meraki.endpoint` target.

### Create a free Meraki Dashboard account

1. Go to the Meraki Dashboard signup page and create an account.
2. Verify email and complete organization setup.
3. Start a trial organization if prompted.

### Create a test network

1. In Dashboard, create a new network (for example: combined network).
2. Add at least one product type in the network profile.
3. If hardware is not available, keep the network as a logical lab network for API experimentation.

### Enable API access

1. Go to Organization settings and enable Dashboard API access.
2. Generate an API key from your user profile.
3. Store the key securely (password manager or secrets vault).

### Suggested lab exercises before CatC production use

1. Perform authenticated GET requests for organizations, networks, and devices.
2. Build a small script that reads network metadata and validates expected fields.
3. Practice idempotent update logic and rollback behavior on non-production objects.

This optional prep helps teams build API discipline and change-control habits that transfer directly to Catalyst Center workflow operations.

## Ordering and Dependencies

Workflows 1.0 through 7.0 are designed to run in strict order to build and deploy site state. Workflows 8.0 through 12.0 are utility and operations workflows that run on demand once that state exists.

```text
1.0 Site Hierarchy
  -> foundation for all site-scoped operations

2.0 Settings and Credentials
  -> requires hierarchy from 1.0

3.0 Device Discovery and Assign
  -> requires settings/credentials and valid hierarchy

4.0 Templates GitHub Integration
  -> can run once GitHub content is available

5.0 Templates Composite
  -> requires member templates from 4.0

6.0 Network Profile
  -> requires hierarchy (1.0) and template artifacts (4.0/5.0)

7.0 Provision Composite
  -> requires managed site-assigned devices (3.0), composite templates (5.0), and profile binding (6.0)

8.0 Command Runner (on-demand)
  -> requires a discovered, managed target device (3.0)

10.0 Paginated Device Inventory (utility / subworkflow)
  -> requires Catalyst Center API access; consumed by 9.0

11.0 Paginated Site Hierarchy (utility / subworkflow)
  -> requires a populated site hierarchy (1.0) for meaningful output

12.0 Bulk Command Runner (utility / subworkflow)
  -> requires the parent workflow to populate the global Device SWIM Inventory table; consumed by 9.0 for pre/post-check capture

9.0 Site Based Upgrade (on-demand)
  -> requires site hierarchy (1.0), discovered managed devices (3.0), and Workflows 10.0 and 12.0 imported as subworkflow dependencies

9.1 Site Based Upgrade with AI (on-demand)
  -> same dependencies as 9.0 plus the Anthropic-AI GenAI endpoint and ANTHROPIC-KEY credential for post-upgrade validation

14.0 Catalyst Center Switch Port Modifier (on-demand, standalone)
  -> requires a discovered, managed switch in Catalyst Center (3.0); independent of the GitOps build chain

15.0 Meraki Switch Port Modifier (on-demand, standalone)
  -> requires a Meraki Dashboard API endpoint target and the switch claimed into the Meraki organization; independent of the Catalyst Center GitOps build chain
```

Recommended rollback/deletion order for workflows 1.0 through 7.0 is reverse execution order to preserve dependency integrity. Workflows 8.0 through 12.0 are read/operations workflows and do not require rollback. Workflows 14.0 and 15.0 are standalone day-2 operations tools that make targeted, operator-confirmed port changes; they have no build-chain dependencies and are not part of the rollback sequence.
